# Nomenclature
This page lists and explains the terms used within VRCFury.

## Global Parameter
Global parameters keep their name as is and are not prefixed with a VF## number.

## Menu Path
Menu Path refers to the path where menu items are found, as seen when navigating the radial menu in-game. It does not refer to the file path of the VRChat expression menu assets.

## Root-only components
To avoid abuse by prefab creators, some VRCFury components are "root-only". This means they can only be placed directly on the root object of the avatar, or on VRCFury-only children of the root.
