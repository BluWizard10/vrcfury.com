# Automatic Fixes

When a VRCFury component or prop is placed anywhere on an avatar, several fixes are activated by default. These fixes are applied
to resolve common VRChat and Unity bugs that we have deemed safe to apply in all scenarios.

* VRChat does not support Animator Override Controllers
  * VRCFury automatically flattens Animator Override Controllers on your descriptor, making them compatible with VRChat.
* Transition times for muscle animations are ignored by unity when placed on layer 0 of an animator
  * VRCFury inserts an empty base layer when this issue is detected
* The VRC avatar descriptor is corrupted and includes two FX layers when you change the avatar rig to generic and back to humanoid
  * VRCFury corrects this issue by keeping the proper FX controller and replacing the other with the missing Action layer
* Assets that were used in an animator previously, but the layer was deleted, are still included in the upload bundle
  * VRCFury corrects this by walking all controllers and building a new copy containing only the layers and states that are actually used
* Controller layers that are empty still take processing time in game
  * VRCFury automatically removes layers that are guaranteed to be empty and have no side-effects
* Animations that target invalid objects still take processing time
  * VRCFury automatically removes animation properties that are guaranteed to be invalid (targeting an object that does not exist)
* States in an additive layer marked as WD off can cause blendshape values to multiply by 3x, and cause unrelated transforms to move continuously
  * VRCFury removes the additive controller that VRChat adds by default (unused by virtually everyone)
  * VRCFury automatically marks all additive states as WD on (only if you opt into Fix Write Defaults)
* States marked as WD off containing a direct blendtree can cause unrelated animations in the controller to break
  * VRCFury automatically marks all direct blendtrees as WD on (only if you opt into Fix Write Defaults)
* The VRCSDK fails with a cryptic error message when menu icons are too large
  * VRCFury detects this condition and shows a useful error message with the icon paths
* VRChat throws away parameters in game if there are more than 256 unique params, even if they are not network synced
  * VRCFury detects this condition and shows a useful error message
* VRChat throws away contacts in game if you have more than 256 total
  * VRCFury detects this condition and shows a useful error message
* VRChat IK and OSC will crash if you have two parameters with the same name, except one has underscores where the other has spaces
  * VRCFury automatically renames parameters conflicting in this way
* VRChat IK and OSC will crash if you have a parameter containing the text `[]`
  * VRCFury automatically renames parameters conflicting in this way
* Controller states and blendtree children with a "None" (missing) animation can break transforms and other animations in avatars using WD off
  * VRCFury automatically replaces missing animations with an empty 1-second clip in these scenarios
* Unity "claims" transforms and muscles for the lowest controller that has them unmasked, even if they are not actively being animated
  * This is a common issue between an avatar's Gesture and FX layers, because when users have no mask in FX, it "claims" all transforms,
    breaking any transforms that are attempted in Gesture.
  * VRCFury solves this issue by merging Gesture and FX into a single controller, individually layer-masking the layers from each to ensure
    they continue working as they did previously.
  * Applying a mask to all FX layers (as recommended in other guides) is not a complete solution, as masking layers is not possible in some
    scenarios (outside the scope of this document).
* Using WD off in a controller state that is placed in a layer at or below a state with WD on causes unity to break all animations in the controller
  * VRCFury detects this scenario and offers the option to solve it automatically by aligning the WD of each setting.
  * Additive layers and direct blendtrees are excluded from this rule, and must always be WD on (as described above).
* MMD worlds do not work properly for avatars using WD off, disable the Gesture controller, and (in some songs) disable FX layer 1 and 2
  * VRCFury automatically resolves all of these issues (only if you opt into VRCFury MMD Compatibility)
* When you delete an int controller parameter and recreate it as a bool, all controller transitions using that parameter will say "True", even though internally they are broken and will never transition.
  * VRCFury automatically corrects these transitions to work if the bool is true, as indicated by the editor.
* When you delete or change the type of a parameter, attempting to use the controller will cause unity to abort the controller entirely, breaking the avatar in the editor and in game
  * VRCFury automatically removes these transitions, as they are never valid
* If one of the controllers on the avatar descriptor is set to "None", unity animation states temporarily reset in between frames, causing Audio Sources to restart every frame
  * VRCFury automatically replaces "None" controllers with an empty replacement
* Non-mobile materials are still included in the quest upload bundle if they are used in animations
  * VRCFury automatically removes all non-mobile materials from quest builds to ensure they are not included in the upload
* VRChat ignores Animator Tracking Control behaviors that run too soon after the avatar is loaded
  * VRCFury buffers all tracking control changes and repeats them several times as the avatar is loaded
* Animator Tracking Control behaviors from various unrelated plugins can break MMD dances
  * VRCFury buffers all tracking control changes and triggers them only once the avatar is not in an MMD station
