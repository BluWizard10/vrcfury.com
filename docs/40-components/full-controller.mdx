> Merge an entire pre-made animator controller into the avatar

This is mostly useful for prefab creators. Provide an animator controller, VRChat expression menu, and expression parameters, and it will be merged into an avatar automatically. 
If you're working on your own avatar, you should usually just add these things to your avatar's own controller, menu, and params instead.

:::note
Animation clips in your specified controller should have animated paths relative
to your prop's root. VRCF will automatically add prefixes to all the animations so they
work wherever it is installed on the avatar. If you wish to animate properties on the avatar
itself (outside of your prop), you can specify a path from the root of the avatar (as you traditionally would), and they will
still work. VRCFury will automatically determine if the path is from the avatar root or from the prop root, and rewrite them
appropriately if needed.
