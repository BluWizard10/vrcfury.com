# Toggle

> Create menu toggles, buttons and sliders

Use this for a normal on/off toggle, button or slider. For simple object props, click `Add Action +`, choose `Object toggle`, and then drag the object into the field. You can also use any of the other [actions](/actions) available within VRCFury. For more advanced "on" states, you can provide an animation clip instead.

## Options

### Menu Path

The name of the toggle in your VRChat radial menu.

Use slashes to place the toggle in a submenu. For example, `Props/My Cool Piano` would place the toggle _My Cool Piano_ in a submenu named _Props_.

### Saved Between Worlds

Saves toggle state between worlds and avatar changes. Use this for options such as outfits, body adjustments, or texture swaps that should stay the same.

### Use Slider Wheel

Convert the toggle into a radial slider. 0 will be the avatar default state, and 100 will be your "enabled" state.
If `Default On` is enabled, a starting value can be set.

### Protect with Security

When a toggle is flagged with the `Security` flag, it can only be enabled when the [Security Lock](/components/other#security-lock) feature is unlocked on your avatar.

### Default On

Automatically enables the prop or animation when the avatar loads. This is useful for idle animations or props that should be on by default.
A toggle set to Default On will also be shown in the avatar's "Rest Pose".\
The "Rest Pose" describes the in-game avatar selector, during full body calibration, and for users who have disabled your avatar's custom animations.

_You can still disable the toggle in-game from your VRChat radial menu._

### Show/Hide when animator disabled

If enabled, this toggle will either appear as enabled or disabled respectively in the avatar's "Rest Pose". Show will automatically swap to Hide if you enable `Default On`.

### Exclusive Tags

If multiple toggles contain the same Exclusive Tag, only one can be active at a time. For example,
if you have multiple sets of clothing which interfere with each other, you can define an exclusive tag `clothing`. When one is enabled, all other toggles with the same tag will be disabled.

Multiple tags can be given, separated by commas.

### Exclusive Off State

Automatically be activated when all other toggles with the same `Exclusive Tags` are disabled. This should be used on the 'default' option for a set of exclusive toggles.

### Set Custom Menu Icon

Sets a Texture2D as the icon of the toggle in the radial menu.

### Separate Local State

Use a separate animation for local and remote machines. The local state will be seen by the user in the avatar, and the remote state will be seen by everyone else.

### Enable Transition State

Creates two additional states for animating a transition between the off and on state. The transition animation will be played forwards when transitioning from off to on and backwards when transitioning from on to off when `Transition Out is reverse of Transition In` is on, otherwise an separate out transition can be set. If `Separate Local State` is enabled, separate local transitions can also be set.

### Use a Global Parameter

Use a given parameter name instead of an autogenerated parameter for the toggle. This is useful if you want to have a toggle that is controlled by via OSC, or if you want to use the same toggle in other places in an Animator.

### Hold Button

The toggle will be enabled while the button is held down, and disabled when is released.

## Toggle Sets ("One At a Time")

There are several ways in VRCFury to create "toggle sets" -- multiple toggles that work together to control outfits, skins, materials, etc on your avatar.

### Solution 1: Create multiple toggles with Exclusive Tags

You could create a separate VRCFury Toggle for each outfit, giving them each a separate path in your menu. Then, in the `Options` section for each toggle, enable `Exclusive Tags` and type the same string into each one. This will cause the outfits to turn each other off -- ensuring that only one will be active in your menu at a time.

The benefit to this solution is that each outfit can have its own descriptive name in your menu, making it more user-friendly.

For advanced outfits (such as a mixture of tops, bottoms, and full-body outfits), you can give multiple Exclusive Tags to a single toggle. For example, your tops could have the exclusive tag `tops`, bottoms have the exclusive tag `bottoms`, and then the full-body outfits would have the tag `tops,bottoms`, causing the full body outfits to automatically turn off all of the tops and bottoms when activated.

### Solution 2: Create a Slider

You can use VRCFury to create a single slider wheel, used to select between all of your outfits / materials.

1. Create a new VRCFury Toggle
2. Click `Options` -> `Use Slider Wheel`
3. Click `Add Action` and choose `Flipbook Builder`
4. Add a page to the flipbook for each outfit / preset / material
5. In each page, add actions like `Material Swap` to customize what happens in that portion of the slider
