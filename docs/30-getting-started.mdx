# Getting Started

1. [Install VRCFury](/download)
1. If you're installing a VRCFury-ready prefab from an artist, stop here! Since their prefab is already setup for VRCFury, you don't need to set up your own components! Simply drag the VRCFury-ready prefab on your avatar and follow instructions if any apply.\
 Tip: If the asset you're trying to add to your avatar does not come with VRCFury already setup, take a look at the prefab-sharing forum on the [VRCFury Discord](https://vrcfury.com/discord), someone might already have made a VRCFury-ready community prefab for your asset!
1. Select your main avatar object, or the prop you are trying to setup, then at the bottom of the Inspector, click `Add Component` and add the VRCFury components you need.\
See the [Components](/components) section for information about each component.
1. Set the components up to your liking or needs. For guides on how to use VRCFury, refer to [Tutorials](/tutorials)
1. You're done! There's no "building" or "applying" to do. VRCFury will non-destructively update your controllers, VRC menus and params automatically before each upload, or when you enter play mode.
