# Avoid Using Constraints with SPS

When setting up raliv DPS by hand, using parent constraints to move a single socket around may be helpful to ensure only one is enabled at a time (enabling more than that one can cause some very unusual issues!).

So why not do this with SPS?

* **Constraints introduce massive amounts of jitter to contacts due to a vrchat bug.** This causes unexpected variations in depth animations and haptics.
* **Deactivated lights have no impact on render performance**. It's not bad to have extra lights that are off.
* **A single socket uses 2 lights, which already marks your vrchat avatar as "Very Poor."** Additional lights won't make your performance rank any worse.
* Parent constraints are very slightly less performant than placing objects directly on their parent bone.
* Re-using one socket prevents all SPS menu features from working, such as Auto mode, Dual mode, etc.
* Re-used sockets cannot have separate animations.
* OGB is unable to detect which specific haptics to activate if a socket is re-used since they all share the same parameter name.
* When socket light and contact installation is automated by VRCFury, it already ensures only one can be active at a time.

To put it simply: **DON'T MIX SPS WITH CONSTRAINTS**
