# Toggle

Use this for a normal "on / off" prop. For simple object props, click `Add Action +`, choose `Object toggle`, and then drag the object into the field. If you choose blendshape, the blendshape will be set to 100 when "on" (only works on root skinned meshes). For more advanced "on" states, you can provide an animation clip instead.

## Options

### Menu Entry

The name you put in the prop's text field will be used as the name of the toggle in your VRChat menu. If you wish to put the prop in a sub-menu, use slashes. Ex: `Props/My Cool Piano`

### Default On

Want to add an idle animation or "default prop" to your avatar? Create a new prop, click the `*` and select `Default On`. Your idle animation or prop will now be on all the time (but you can also trigger it back off in game!)

### Show in Rest Pose

If set, this toggle will be enabled in the avatar's "Rest Pose".
This means the toggle will shown "on" in the in-game avatar selector, during
full body calibration, and for users who have disabled your avatar's
animations.

### Slider

Select `Slider` from the `*` menu, and VRC Fury will make the prop into a slider rather than a toggle. 0 will be the avatar default state, and 100% will be your "enabled" state.
If `Default On` is also set, an arbitrary starting value can be set.

### Saved

Not everything in VRC Fury has to be a temporary prop. Want to save your clothes (or anything else?) across worlds? Select `Saved between worlds` in the `*` menu.

### Security

When a prop is flagged with the `Security` flag, it can only be enabled when the Security Lock feature is unlocked on your avatar (see the Security Lock section for more details).

### Physbone Reset

Got an animation that changes parameters on a physbone?

Click the advanced `*` button on the VRC Fury prop for the animation, then click `Add PhysBone to Reset`. Drag the object for the physbone into the box (it should be on an empty by itself). VRC Fury will automatically flip the bone off and on any time your animation is run or reset, causing the physbone to reload your changed settings.

### Exclusive Tags

If multiple toggles contain the same Exclusive Tag, only one can be active at a time. For example,
if you have multiple sets of clothing which interfere with each other, you can give them the
same tag. When one is enabled, all other toggles with the same tag will be disabled. Multiple tags
can be given, separated by commas.

### Exclusive Tag Off State

If set, this toggle will automatically be activated when all other toggles with the same
`Exclusive Tags` are disabled. This makes it usable as an "Off" state for a set of conflicting
toggles.

### Separate Local State

If set, this creates a separate animation for local and remote machines. The local state will be seen by the user in the avatar, and the remote state will be seen by everyone else.

### Enable Transition State

If set, this will create 2 additional states for animating a transition between the off and on state. The transition animation will be played forwards when transitioning from off to on and backwards when transitioning from on to off when `Transition Out is reverse of Transition In` is on, otherwise an separate out transition can be set. If `Separate Local State` is also on, separate local transitions can also be set.

### Use a Global Parameter

If set, this will use a given parameter name instead of an autogenerated parameter for the toggle. This is useful if you want to have a toggle that is controlled by via OSC, or if you want to use the same toggle in other places in an Animator.

### Hold Button

If set, this will make the toggle the button type instead of a toggle. This means that the toggle will be enabled while the button is held down, and disabled when the button is released.
