# Troubleshooting / Errors / FAQ

## VRCFury doesn't show up or install or update {#script-errors}

> The associated script can not be loaded. Please fix any compile errors and assign a valid script.

Does it seem like the installer isn't doing anything, or you installed but VRCFury still doesn't show up? Usually this is
caused by something else broken in your project. If ANY script in your project is broken, it breaks THE WHOLE THING, including
VRCFury.

### Are you using the VCC **AND** do you have an `Assets/VRCSDK` folder in your project?

* If so, you have two conflicting copies of the VRCSDK.
* Open the VCC, go to Manage Your Project, downgrade the vrcsdk to any previous version, then upgrade it again.
* This will automatically clean up the conflicting copy.

### Still not fixed?

* Open the Unity Console tab in Unity, then click Clear on the top left. Take note of any errors.
* If there are errors related to AV3Manager, delete the folder for that plugin.
* If there are errors related to AV3Emulator, delete the folder for that plugin and (optionally) use Gesture Manager instead.
* If there are errors related to Poiyomi, delete the Assets/_PoiyomiShaders folder and import a fresh copy from their website.
* If there are errors related to Gesture Manager, ensure it is up to date in the VCC or get a fresh copy from their github.
* If there are errors related to some other script, try deleting it if you don't need it.

## Extra Field can't be serialized

> Type '[VRCFury]...' has an extra field '...' of type '...' in the player, and thus can't be serialized

This can happen if unity gets confused in the middle of a VRCFury upgrade.

* Remove VRCFury using the VCC
* Click on unity to wake it up and make it aware of the removal
* Reinstall VRCFury using the VCC again

## Assembly search path does not exist

> The assembly search path '.../com.vrcfury.vrcfury/Libs' does not exist

This is a warning and can be ignored. It happens if you uninstall VRCFury because unity will not
unload VRCFury's DLL's until the next time it restarts.

## Poiyomi is broken

> Assets\_PoiyomiShaders\Scripts\... error: No overload for method...
> Assets\_PoiyomiShaders\Scripts\... error: ... does not contain a definition for ...
> Assets\_PoiyomiShaders\Scripts\... error: etc

* This is not a VRCFury issue.
* Your Poiyomi is out of date and broken, and it is breaking all scripts in your project.
* Update Poiyomi using the VCC at https://poiyomi.github.io/vpm/

## Preprocess Callback Failed

> The VRCSDK build was aborted because the VRCSDKPreprocessAvatarCallback 'PreuploadHook' reported a failure

* This error just means 'The build failed for some reason', and has no meaning.
* For the root cause, check the popup or error that occurred before this one.

## Failed to create state behaviour

> Failed to create state behaviour of type ... Usually this means you have an error in one of your other non-vrcfury packages.

* An error should be listed in the message.
* Delete the package mentioned in the error if you are not using it, or upgrade it to a new version otherwise.
* If no error is listed, follow the steps in [VRCFury doesn't show up or install or update](#script-errors)

## Missing script

> You are trying to replace or create a Prefab from the instance ... that references a missing script. This is not allowed.

* If you believe the missing script is VRCFury, follow the instructions
  at [VRCFury doesn't show up or install or update](#script-errors)
* Some unity packages still come with old dynamic bones. If your missing scripts are on places where dynamic bones may exist
  (like ears, tails, dresses, etc), import the [dynamic bones stub](https://github.com/VRLabs/Dynamic-Bones-Stub/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
  then in unity, choose `VRChat SDK > Utilities > Convert DynamicBones to PhysBones`. Note that this is not an issue related to VRCFury,
  so we cannot provide support regarding Dynamic Bones.

## Synced layers disappear

* Do not use synced layers in any controllers in your project.
* A unity bug causes synced layers to vanish any time a layer (even an unrelated one) is removed from any controller.
* An alternative solution is to duplicate the layer you want to sync, or drive a paramter from the first layer when you need
  to trigger something in the second layer.

## Blendshapes are clamped from 0 to 100

* This is a VRChat limitation.
* Although the unity editor allows blendshapes to be outside this range, once in game, VRChat uses a unity setting called
  `Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated)` which forces them to remain within the 0-100 range.
* You can enable this `Clamp Blendshapes` option in the Player settings in the editor to replicate how it will work in game.

## FixGestureFxConflict Conflicting Parameter Type

> VRCF tried to create parameter ??? with type ??? in controller FX, but parameter already exists with type ???

* Check the gesture and FX controllers set in your avatar's Avatar Descriptor.
* Look in the parameters tab of each. It's likely that you have the same parameter listed in both, but with different types.
* Usually, you can delete the conflicting parameter from Gesture to resolve the issue.
