# Download and Install

## Method 1. VRChat Creator Companion

* [Click here to add VRCFury to the VRChat Creator Companion](vcc://vpm/addRepo?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvcc.vrcfury.com)
  * Didn't work? In the VCC, go to Settings > Packages > Add Repository, type `https://vcc.vrcfury.com` and click Add
* In the list, make sure `VRCFury Repo` is checked
* Find your project in the VCC project list, click `Manage Project`, then add VRCFury.
* To update VRCFury later on, you can do so by returning to the `Manage Project` VCC page.

## Method 2. VRCFury Installer

* Download and import the [VRCFury Installer](https://vrcfury.com/installer)
* To update VRCFury later on, you can do so in unity at `Tools > VRCFury > Update VRCFury`.

## Method 3. OpenUPM (Advanced Users Only)

VRCFury is available on the OpenUPM at https://openupm.com/packages/com.vrcfury.vrcfury/

## Troubleshooting

Does it seem like the installer isn't doing anything, or you installed but VRCFury still doesn't show up? Usually this is
caused by something else broken in your project. If ANY script in your project is broken, it breaks THE WHOLE THING, including
VRCFury.

#### Are you using the VCC **AND** do you have an `Assets/VRCSDK` folder in your project?

* If so, you have two conflicting copies of the VRCSDK.
* Open the VCC, go to Manage Your Project, downgrade the vrcsdk to any previous version, then upgrade it again.
* This will automatically clean up the conflicting copy.

#### Still not fixed?

* Open the Unity Console tab in Unity, then click Clear on the top left. Take note of any errors.
* If there are errors related to AV3Manager, delete the folder for that plugin.
* If there are errors related to AV3Emulator, delete the folder for that plugin and (optionally) use Gesture Manager instead.
* If there are errors related to Poiyomi, delete the Assets/_PoiyomiShaders folder and import a fresh copy from their website.
* If there are errors related to Gesture Manager, ensure it is up to date in the VCC or get a fresh copy from their github.
* If there are errors related to some other script, try deleting it if you don't need it.
